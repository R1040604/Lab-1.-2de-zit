            <p class="tekst">We are kicking off our photography club in early October with a creative blast: the
                FlashWalk. During this group photo walk, we will explore the city together at sunset, searching for the
                interplay of light, color, and shadow. It will be an accessible and inspiring way to get to know each
                other and immediately take the first photos for our community.
                The FlashWalk will be followed by an introductory workshop, where you will receive practical tips on
                composition, lighting, and creative storytelling with your camera or smartphone. This workshop is
                perfect for both beginners and experienced photographers who want to gain new inspiration.

                At the same time, we will launch our social media campaign to promote our new club and get future
                members excited. This will culminate in our first major highlight: the official opening of our first
                exhibition. During this exhibition, we will showcase the work of our members and celebrate the launch of
                a club that connects, inspires, and makes photography accessible to everyone.</p>

            <p class="tekst">A fun and creative evening walk where you will get to know the city in a new way and learn
                how to photograph it. We will focus on capturing the interplay between light and shadow at sunset, with
                plenty of opportunity to ask questions and exchange tips.
                Afterwards, there will be a practical workshop where you can further develop your photography skills.
